# Cryptocurrencies

### The purpose of this project
To learn what the unsupervised learning is used for, how to process data, how to cluster, how to reduce your dimensions, and how to reduce the principal components using PCA. The challenge is to put all these skills to use by creating an analysis for your clients who are preparing to get into the cryptocurrency market. We have to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

### The Processing of the challenge

1. Preprocessing the Data for PCA
2. Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
3. Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
4. Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results

### Clustering Cryptocurrencies using K-Means - Elbow Curve
